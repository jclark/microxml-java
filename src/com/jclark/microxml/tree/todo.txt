Method on Element to compare document order of two elements.

toString methods

It would be nice if it was possible to share a superclass with an immutable implementation.

trimToSize on Element and AttributeSet

Some sort of simple path language that addresses elements: probably extended subset of CSS3 selectors.

Be able to associate elements with a syntax: class, lang, parse serialize, case sensitivity. Elements in the
same tree should have the same syntax.

Property like innerHTML.

Keep a cache of an Element's text as a String. For a text chunk return a substring of the cached string.

Do querying like Stream in Java 8.
