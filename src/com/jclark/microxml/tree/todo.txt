MicroXML parser that handles Locations.

Method on Element to compare document order of two elements. Maybe implement Comparable and return value based
on document order.  This will require an ordering a root nodes. Add a RootInfo field to Element: lazily create
this for root Elements and include in it a sequence number. (Could also use RootInfo for a tree modCount.)

toString methods

It would be nice if it was possible to share a superclass with an immutable implementation.

trimToSize on Element and AttributeSet

Some sort of simple path language that addresses elements: probably extended subset of CSS3 selectors.

Be able to associate elements with a syntax: class, lang, parse serialize, case sensitivity. Elements in the
same tree should have the same syntax.

Property like innerHTML.

Keep a cache of an Element's text as a String. For a text chunk return a substring of the cached string.

Do querying like Stream in Java 8.

XML Builder should have PIHandler property to be able to process PIs before the Document Element.
